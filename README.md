# DNALang
In our 4th semester project, we designed and implemented a simple programming language, for manipulation of DNA sequences.

The compiler is implemeted using Java, and targets Java code. The compiler will forward the generated Java code to the Java compiler, and output the resuling compilation directly.
We also utilized ANTLR for lexing and parsing.

The accompanying project report is also prodvided here, as a PDF (Although this is written in danish).
